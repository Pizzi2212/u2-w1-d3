        <h3>Manga World</h3>
        <p>
          In the heart of the province of London, a fascinating story is born
          that has shaped the panorama of Italian comics. It all began in the
          1980s, when, after the decline of Labor Comics, Sergio Cavallin
          proposed an ambitious project to the young printer Giovanni Bovini:
          acquiring the rights to American Marvel. Thus Edizioni Star Comics was
          born, initially a modest project, which quickly transformed into a
          publishing empire of national resonance. The name "Star Comics",
          coined by Cavallerin himself together with the first logo, has become
          the shining beacon of the Italian comics world. "Star" was chosen as
          an omen, a promise of excellence and brightness in the comic
          firmament. The publishing house quickly established itself as one of
          the most important companies in Italy, publishing iconic characters
          such as Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Captain America, Spawn, Sin City
          and many others. Also worth underlining is the importance that the
          publishing house had for the diffusion of Japanese manga, which at the
          time was still little known in Italy. Star Comics was the first, with
          Dragon Ball, to publish the volumes in the original reading style,
          that is, from right to left and from top to bottom.
